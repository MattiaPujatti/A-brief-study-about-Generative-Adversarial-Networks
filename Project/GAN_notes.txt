tanh for generator
sigmoid for discriminator
pre-train the discriminator?
use different games?
plot accuracy/loss
dense or conv2dT or Upsampling?
preprocess images?
use different learning rate (disc>gen) to slow down the generator so that the discriminator
learn to classify better?
label smoothing (allow the discriminator to generalize better)
in dcgan no fully connected hidden layers 
no kernel_init=randomnormal for shapes (too many colors)
give a look at all the problems in training GANs
before tune hyperpar, then change loss


HYPERPARAMETERS:

beta1 = 0.9, 0.5
lr = 0.001, 0.0001
mini_batch = 128, 256
